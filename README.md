# Easel - Netlify based subscriber content
> A tiny set of scripts that allow you to make your own subscriber site with Netlify.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/9dc75eb5-dca6-4d0a-ba1e-90111e070764/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/melodious-kitsune-56de31/deploys)

This repository provide a template that allows you to build subscriber or paid content sites with Netlify. It's aimed at people wanting to provide premium content unlocked with one of charges or subscriptions. You will need to be somewhat handson to get this to work (hopefully not too much, as I have tried to distill the information you need from the various docs).

The crux of the setup is a:
- NextJS based starter site configured to run on Netlify
- Tailwind CSS integration
- Markdoc plugin to support code sample
- Support for downloads files (Zip, PDF, etc)

Alongside we provide Netlify functions that work with Stripe to accept payments and create subscriptions.

Before you get started you will need:

- [ ] Github or Gitlab account
- [ ] A [Netlify](https://netlify.com) account
- [ ] A [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account

Features:
- Allow users to sign up and manage their account
- Allow users to view / manage their purchases subscriptions
- Basic structure of subscription and paid content using `netlify.toml`
- Instructions on how to use the template
- Command Line Interface based examples to automate actions

If you are interested in how the template is designed, please look at [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md).
